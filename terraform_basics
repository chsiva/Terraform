Terraform init, Terraform plan & apply
If you want to change the name/config 
step1: delete the state file & change name in main file & then apply. ( if new one required).
Step2: rename and apply so resource will be replaced with a new name by deleteing the old one.



# What is terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup file in terraform?
The state file is used by Terraform to keep track of resources and metadata information about your infrastructure. 
By default, the state of your environment is stored locally in your Terraform workspace directory in a file called terraform.tfstate along with a backup file 
called terraform.tfstate.backup. 
The state file will not exist until you have completed at least one terraform apply.

So, When you run terraform apply then the state will be updated if changes have been made. 
The previous version will be saved as terraform.tfstate.backup.
